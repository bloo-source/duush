# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers of Bloofocus, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment for our community include:

- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.
- Actively contributing to the project and fostering a collaborative spirit.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
- Any conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They may take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including GitHub repositories, pull requests, issues, and related forums (e.g., mailing lists, social media). It also applies in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [siddhant.mishra@dnif.it]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other project maintainers.
